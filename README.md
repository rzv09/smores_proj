Extensive microbial and meiofaunal communities hosted by marine sediments rely on oxidants for mineralization, which can be introduced by physical and biological processes like tidal pumping or bioturbation. Limited understanding of the impact of this dynamic oxygenation exists, which necessitates further investigation. Several challenges related to sampling hinder progress: oxygenation events are transient and spatially heterogeneous, making it difficult to determine when and where critical biogeochemical processes are occurring. Traditional fixed-interval or spatially uniform sampling strategies often miss these short-lived or localized events, leading to incomplete or misleading data. Additionally, in remote or long-duration deployments, power and storage constraints limit the frequency and resolution of sampling. These limitations call for a “smarter” optimized sampling approach—one that can dynamically adapt to environmental signals, prioritize informative time windows, and guide sensing efforts based on real-time and historical data. Such an approach requires machine learning-driven decision-making to improve efficiency, reduce redundancy, and maximize scientific yield.
